# Radiomics-research-by-using-Python
Radiomics (here mainly means hand-crafted based radiomics) contains data acquire, ROI segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, machine learning modeling, and stastical analysis.

## Note:
It might not be an easy task, but the effort could prove worthwhile—or as a prominent political figure might have said, had he done research in radiomics: “We should choose to bring radiomics to clinical routine in this decade, not because it is easy, but because it is hard; because the goal should be to serve our patients and improve outcomes”.

Good, it's from a paper titled "A decade of radiomics research: are images really data or just patterns in the noise?" in European Radiology. 
I want to say, let's do it!
